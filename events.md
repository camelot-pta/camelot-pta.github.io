# Events

## Community Building

We have several community-focused events that are free or break even to allow all our families to participate.

* Our first event of the year is the ice cream social. International night is completely free for our families and donates food items and volunteers who provide entertainment make it a fun-filled evening.  

* Field day is run by PTA volunteers and provides all the kids an opportunity to participate during one exciting day in the sprint. 

* We also sponsor educational programs that have fees that just cover your childâ€™s registration. They include the FLEX language programs, pottery, and drama programs. 
    * They run as before or after school programs that occur once an week over a period of several months. We hope to expand these and are always looking for new ideas.

## Fund Raising

In addition to hosting activities to build community, we also raise money through several significant events including:

* Bingo Night

* Silent Auction
