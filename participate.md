## Getting Involved

How do I get involved?

Come to our monthly PTA meetings, scheduled the second Tuesday of every month during the school year at 7PM in the library and hear about the upcoming events and opportunities to get involved. The principle will give us the latest news and we will review community and legislative highlights too.

It’s a great way to stay up to date with the latest news. Read the minutes from those meetings so you can stay on top of current events if you can’t make it to the meetings.

Volunteer for an event by filling in the volunteer form that goes home in the first Tuesday packet of the year or check on the website for specific sign ups for events. We will have more opportunities to sign up online to make it easier for everyone.

Contact an event coordinator and ask how you can help. They will always have a place for you!
