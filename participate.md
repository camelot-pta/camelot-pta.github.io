## Getting Involved

Come to our monthly PTA meetings, scheduled the last Tuesday of every month during the school year at 7PM in the library and hear about the upcoming events and opportunities to get involved. The Principal will give us   the latest news and we will review community and legislative highlights too. It’s a great way to stay up to    date with the latest information regarding our school. 

[Read the minutes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B08CHuPjOEKWRndSNDQ5V1BPS2c) from those meetings posted here on the PTA website so you can stay on top of current events if you can’t make it to the meetings.

Watch for volunteer opportunities at social events, classroom support or community activities. Contact an event coordinator and ask how you can help. They will always have a place for you!
