## About Camelot PTA

The Camelot Parent Teacher Association (PTA) is a non-profit volunteer organization that supports the Camelot Elementary School. The PTA's mission is to make every child’s potential a reality by engaging and empowering families and communities to advocate for all children. 

Camelot’s PTA supports our school through various means, such as funding field trips for all grade levels, planning after school educational programs, engaging the school community through social events (ice cream social, Fall Festival, Bingo, Silent Auction, Parent Teach Basketball game), in-school assemblies, and classroom teaching tools.

The Camelot PTA is focused on supporting our school and children by being:
* directly involved in programs that benefit our children.
* offering suggestions when the staff needs a parental point of view.
* helping plan ongoing programs and often are there to support initiatives that bring new ideas to the school.
* offering the teachers and administrators support whenever we can!

We are focused on supporting the national PTA Values of: 
* **Collaboration**: We will work in partnership with a wide array of individuals and organizations to broaden and enhance our ability to serve and advocate for all children and families.
* **Commitment**: We are dedicated to children’s educational success, health, and well-being through strong family and community engagement, while remaining accountable to the principles upon which our association was founded.
* **Diversity**: We acknowledge the potential of everyone without regard, including but not limited to: age, culture, economic status, educational background, ethnicity, gender, geographic location, legal status, marital status, mental ability, national origin, organizational position, parental status, physical ability, political philosophy, race, religion, sexual orientation, and work experience.
* **Respect**: We value the individual contributions of members, employees, volunteers, and partners as we work collaboratively to achieve our association’s goals.
* **Accountability**: All members, volunteers, and partners have a shared responsibility to align their efforts toward the achievement of our association’s strategic initiatives.

It is though ongoing involvement where the more of us that are involved the more we can get done! Please consider joining the PTA and becoming involved in continuing to make Camelot great!

## Community Building

We have several community-focused events that are free or ask for a nominal fee in order to cover costs to allow all our families to participate.

Our first event of the year is the ice cream social. This event is a perfect time to meet new friends, teachers and enjoy free ice cream!

The Fall Festival is a fun even filled with hay rides, face painting, arts and crafts and all things that make celebrating the fall a great time of year. Lots of volunteers make this event a fun time for all ages. 

International night is wonderful event celebrating the diversity of our school community. Moved to the fall this year, this completely free event is enhanced through home cooked food celebrating the rich cultures of Camelot. Volunteers provide amazing entertainment to make it a fun-filled evening.

We also sponsor educational programs that have fees that just cover your child’s registration. Classes have included guitar, keyboard, drama and other programs to enrich our students learning. Classes run typically after school and occur once a week over a period of several months. We hope to expand these and are always looking for new ideas.

The PTA also runs an after school Cheer Program for both girls and boys to learn basic cheerleading skills. For a small fee, all participants receive a Camelot Cheer t-shirt and perform in several of our community building and fundraising events with a final performance at the Parent Teacher Basketball Game.

## Fund Raising

Camelot PTA cannot accomplish all of the activities to build community and support our school without raising money through several significant events including:
* Fun Run
* Bingo Night
* Silent Auction
* Parent Teacher Basketball Game and
* Restaurant Nights

If you have fundraising or community ideas please <a href="mailto:webmaster@camelotpta.org?Subject=Website%20Question">contact us</a>!

## Getting Involved

* Come to our monthly PTA meetings, scheduled the last Tuesday of every month during the school year at 7PM in the library and hear about the upcoming events and opportunities to get involved. The Principal will give us the latest news and we will review community and legislative highlights too. It’s a great way to stay up to date with the latest information regarding our school. 

* Read the minutes from those meetings posted on the PTA website so you can stay on top of current events if you can’t make it to the meetings.

* Watch for volunteer opportunities at social events, classroom support or community activities. Contact an event coordinator and ask how you can help. They will always have a place for you!
