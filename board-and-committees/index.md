## Membership: YOU ARE THE PTA!

Do you want your child to get the most out of school? Lead by example and join the Camelot Elementary PTA. Camelot enjoys a diverse population both at our school and in the surrounding community. This variety adds depth to our multicultural celebrations and to our children's education. Become a member and be active in your child's education at the local state and national level.

There are many advantages to becoming a PTA member:

  * **Having a Voice** - you will have input on what events and programs the PTA sponsors

  * **Being a Role Model** - show your child the importance you place on education

  * **Enjoying Membership Benefits** - you can receive discounts on macazine subscriptions, hotels, resturants, travel, and leadership training

Joining the PTA isn't just about the membership fee that gets you a year's worth of social events, information, and access to state and national PTA programs and benefits. 

That membership fee is a token of your commitment to your children and school. Your voice counts because our PTA members decide what events, activities, and programs we sponsor and how best to support our Camelot community.
